# High-Level Workflow
#
#     Initialization:
#         The chat interface (e.g., terminal, web interface) is initialized.
#         The CoachAgent (ConversableAgent) welcomes the human user and establishes rapport.
#         The CoachAgent and human user discuss and collaboratively set learning goals.
#         The LearnerModelAgent (AssistantAgent) is initialized to represent the learner's knowledge and skill level.
#
#     Learning Loop:
#         Needs Assessment: The TutorAgent (ConversableAgent) assesses the LearnerModelAgent to estimate the learner's current knowledge.
#         Content Selection:
#             The TutorAgent consults the ContentProviderAgent (AssistantAgent) based on the assessment.
#             The ContentProviderAgent retrieves suitable learning materials.
#         Content Delivery: The TutorAgent presents the content to the human user through the chat interface.
#         Human Input:
#             The TutorAgent poses questions or tasks to the human user via the chat interface.
#             The chat interface captures the human user's responses.
#         Evaluation:
#             The EvaluatorAgent (AssistantAgent) evaluates the human user's response and updates the LearnerModelAgent accordingly.
#             The VerifierAgent (AssistantAgent) double-checks the evaluation for accuracy and offers alternative perspectives if necessary.
#         Feedback:
#             The TutorAgent provides feedback to the human user through the chat interface, focusing on strengths and areas for improvement.
#             The CoachAgent offers motivational support and reinforces positive learning behaviors through the chat interface.
#             The LearnerModelAgent updates its internal representation of the learner's knowledge based on the feedback.
#
#     Adaptation & Progress Tracking:
#         The TutorAgent and CoachAgent continuously analyze the LearnerModelAgent to adapt the learning path and content selection in real time.
#         The CoachAgent engages in periodic conversations with the human user to discuss progress, goals, and challenges.
#
#     Termination:
#         When the learning goals are met or the user decides to end the session, the CoachAgent provides a summary of the learner's progress and offers encouragement.
#
# Example Message Flow:

#     Tutor: "Welcome to the math tutor! Let's get started. What areas of math are you interested in?"
#     Human: "I want to learn about algebra."
#     Tutor (to ContentProvider): "Please provide a question about algebra."
#     ContentProvider (to Tutor): "What is the quadratic formula?"
#     Tutor (to Human): "What is the quadratic formula?"
#     Human: "x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, all over 2a"
#     Tutor (to Evaluator): "Evaluate the answer: 'x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, all over 2a'"
#     Evaluator (to Verifier): "The answer is correct."
#     Verifier (to Tutor): "Confirmed: The answer is correct."
#     Tutor (to Human): "That's absolutely right! The quadratic formula is x = (-b Â± âˆš(bÂ² - 4ac)) / 2a"
