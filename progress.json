It states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In mathematical terms, if a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then the theorem can be expressed as:\n\n\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\)\n\nThis theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who is credited with its discovery. It has numerous applications in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and more. Would you like me to provide an example to illustrate how the Pythagorean Theorem works?", "name": "TutorAgent", "role": "user", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T23:46:54.800028"}]
