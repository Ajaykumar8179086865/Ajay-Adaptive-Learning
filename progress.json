        "content": "The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that relates to right-angled triangles. It states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In mathematical terms, if a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then the theorem can be expressed as:\n\n\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\)\n\nThis theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who is credited with its discovery. It has numerous applications in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and more. Would you like me to provide an example to illustrate how the Pythagorean Theorem works?",

        "content": "Certainly! Let's start with the basics of algebra. Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. These symbols represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations.\n\n### 1. **Basic Concepts of Algebra**\n\n#### Variables and Constants\n- **Variables**: Symbols (usually letters) that represent unknown values. For example, \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\).\n- **Constants**: Fixed values that do not change. For example, numbers like 2, 5, or -3.\n\n#### Expressions\nAn algebraic expression is a combination of variables, constants, and arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). For example:\n\\[ 3x + 2 \\]\n\\[ 4y - 5 \\]\n\\[ 2a^2 + 3b - 7 \\]\n\n#### Equations\nAn equation states that two expressions are equal. It contains an equals sign (=). For example:\n\\[ 3x + 2 = 11 \\]\n\\[ 4y - 5 = 15 \\]\n\n### 2. **Solving Simple Equations**\n\nLet's solve a simple linear equation step-by-step.\n\n#### Example: Solve \\( 3x + 2 = 11 \\)\n\n**Step 1: Isolate the variable term**\nSubtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 3x + 2 - 2 = 11 - 2 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 9 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Solve for the variable**\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\\[ \\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} \\]\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\nSo, the solution to the equation \\( 3x + 2 = 11 \\) is \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n### 3. **Working with Inequalities**\n\nInequalities are similar to equations but instead of an equals sign, they use inequality symbols:\n- \\( < \\) (less than)\n- \\( > \\) (greater than)\n- \\( \\leq \\) (less than or equal to)\n- \\( \\geq \\) (greater than or equal to)\n\n#### Example: Solve \\( 2x - 5 < 7 \\)\n\n**Step 1: Isolate the variable term**\nAdd 5 to both sides:\n\\[ 2x - 5 + 5 < 7 +",

I'll ask ProblemGeneratorAgent to generate a few problems for you.\n\n#### Problem 1: Solve the equation \\( 4y + 3 = 19 \\)\n\n#### Problem 2: Solve the inequality \\( 5z - 4 \\geq 11 \\)\n\nLet's start with these two problems.
